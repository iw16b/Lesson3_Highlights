            </h2>
            <p class="lead">SSH Keys (Secure Shell) are used in order to be identified on an SSH server which requires authentication methods. It is used to login remotely from various different systems, and uses strong encryption code to carry out remote commands, and manage network infrastructure. Personal SSH key pairs may be generated and downloaded to service different SSH servers. SSH keys allow modern cloud services and languages to be accessed in data centers and corporations for example. This is interesting because data sensitive corporations tend to use SSH keys when working on cloud services, which makes the workplace more secure. It also makes sense as a student and teacher in a class environment.

                <span class="text-muted">Push</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Pushing files are adding files to the remote repository from local. For example, using the “git push” to push the commits to the brand and remote repository. This topic explains how people in a workspace are constantly pushing and pulling files to a repository. Pushing is done after saved changes are made to a file, and can be modified they can also be pulled again. This can relate to adding a new file to a team project to your repository and taking the file out to be modified. Github is an example of an IDE which allows you to integrate your repository where data is pushed to.

                <span class="text-muted">Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Repository is a place where data is filed and maintained, multiple databases are accessible to users without having to go across networks. It is also used by version control systems in order to store multiple files. A repository may also be configured on a local machine for a user to access multiple software packages. This topic is relevant because they allow efficient ways for saving development and programming files. When working on large student projects it can be helpful for many users to access the repository. Changes can also be committed and extracted which is beneficial about a repository.

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is for management of multiple versions of computer programs and files. It allows users to lock the files to be edited by a single user, and tracks each changes made to a file. In order for no two users to work on the file at the same time, version control can check out files so they cannot be edited. This is important in a workplace, and prevents overriding code and track each change. All files must be saved, in a central location called a repository. When new files are updated they are committed. This relates to setting up the version control system Git.

                <span class="text-muted">Backup</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Backup is having an additional copy for the original data. Backing up files is important when it comes to protecting data, and safely storing it. Not only can you have hardware issues, but software malfunctions may also occur. It is important to backup important projects, and data sensitive files so you may never have to experience file loss due to having just one copy. 
Data can be backed, and pushed to a repository for access of other users. External storage devices, hard drives, and other computers are used to make backups, where files and folders can be safely transferred.
